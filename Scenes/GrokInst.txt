Follow PascalCase naming conventions for FileNames.cs, Nodes, and Methods().  Variables should be bool lower_case with underscore between words where useful.  Instances should be _camelCase preceded by underscores.  Direct Node references should be as presented in Godot. All naming should be descriptive of function.  Existing asset names vary;  future assets should be named in lower_case with underscores between words.  Present all example scenes as Node3D's to align with the 3D presentation used throughout War Eagles.
