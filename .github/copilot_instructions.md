War Eagles is being developed in Godot 4.4.1, with the aid of Grok 3 for research, planning assistance, and coding.  The effort is centrally informed by an emphasis on thorough, flexible planning, following an overall outline and performing in depth planning prior to each phase and execution segment.  The greatest possible emphasis is placed on the user experience;  good enough isn't.   The following documents located in D://War Eagles Digital/war-eagles-digital/Docs should give a start on informing your efforts in support of the development process;  please request inputs in preference to assuming data when you need it, even at the cost of using queries.

The planned workflow is described in Guidelines.md and consists in brief of: User defines requirements-Grok creates a pseudocode prompt-User reviews prompt-User inputs prompt to Copilot-Copilot prroduces code-User uses Intellisense and Grok to review code-code is implemented and debugged by user and Grok, with Copilot help where appropriate.

This solution incorporates in part the following documents in res://Docs:

StandardRules.md  is the rules of play of the original, wood-block iteration.  It is used to define and describe the playflow.
TechStack.md describes the target hardware and software configuration for the distro, and the hardware and software development environment.
Guidelines.md defines the coding standards and naming conventions used, resource management, coding workflow, and error handling.
SolutionStructure.md  provides paths and filenames for assets, resources, scenes, informational documents ,and scripts.
WE_Structure.md provides a guide to the scene structure and autoloads for the game.  It includes method listings for the autoloads: Scripts/AudioManager.cs, Scripts/UnitDatabase.cs, and Scripts/GameManager.cs.
WE_Workflow.md is the primary roadmap and guide for task setting and completion.  It is updated as tasks are completed, and as planning is performed for development phases.
