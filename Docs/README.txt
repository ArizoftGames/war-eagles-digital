WAR EAGLES (TM) DIGITAL PROJECT README
War Eagles (TM)  Digital is a port of a tabletop game designed in 1995 by Geoffrey Bohrer.  It began as a collectible card game of WWII aircraft, became a miniatures game, and finally became a wood-block game with labels.  The game is a digital tabletop, turn-based strategy game, played in ten turns.  Players setup their air forces at the beginning of the game and vie to inflict damage upon their opponent's target while protecting their own with limited resources.  Gameplay is strong influenced by the theories of air power prevalent before and during World War II.

The games employs a visual aesthetic of aircraft miniatures being used on a well-constructed sand table or miniatures-game play surface.  The models themselves are as detailed as may be while accenting performance on a computer with limited video capability.  The audio aesthietic is built around national themes, with tracks reminiscent of national character and the music of the period.  Sound effects are drawn from life.  The primary directive of the development effort is user experience; good playflow and mechanics are second, with fidelity to the original design and historical accuracy being considerations as well.

This solution incorporates in part the following documents in D:/War Eagles DIgital/war-eagles-digital/Docs:

StandardRules.md  is the rules of play of the original, wood-block iteration.  It is used to define and describe the playflow.
TechStack.md describes the target hardware and software configuration for the distro, and the hardware and software development environment

Guidelines.md defines the coding standards and naming conventions used, resource management, coding workflow, and error handling.
SolutionStructure.md  provides paths and filenames for assets, resources, scenes, informational documents ,and scripts.
WE_Structure.md provides a guide to the scene structure and autoloads for the game.  It includes method listings for the autoloads: Scripts/AudioManager.cs, Scripts/UnitDatabase.cs, and Scripts/GameManager.cs.
WE_Workflow.md is the primary roadmap and guide for task setting and completion.  It is updated as tasks are completed, and as planning is performed for development phases.
