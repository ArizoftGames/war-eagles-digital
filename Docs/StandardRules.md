War Eagles
STANDARD RULES
Â©1995, 2005 Geoffrey T. Bohrer

INTRODUCTION

From 1939 to 1945, the world was engulfed in the flames of war. Stories of villainy and heroism, courage and sacrifice, still thrill us decades later. And nowhere was that war as hard-fought as in the skies.

From Rio de Janeiro to Murmansk, the Central Pacific to North Africa, war was blazoned across the sky. The air above the battlefield had become the new "high ground." Each nation built hundreds of thousands of flying machines to contest this new battleground- and now, with War Eagles, you can command them. Build an air force, select your targets, and take charge!

GETTING STARTED

This Starter Set contains miniatures, dice, stat cards, event cards, and zone Cards. There's more than enough materials here to play the Quickstart Rules; but for maximum enjoyment, and to play with the Standard Rules, you'll want to get some Booster Packs, which contain more miniatures, events, and Zone Cards.

1. Flip a Coin

The winner of the coin toss decides who will be the First Player, and also whether to play the Axis or the Allies.

2. Select Zone Cards

Each player selects (five) Zone Cards to represent his or her hand territory. These Zone Cards will form the game board. Zone Cards are "unique"; that is, you may not select more than one Zone Card containing the same Target Unit (for example, you can't choose two copies of the "Berlin" zone card).

Each player should select his or her Zone Cards secretly, revealing their selections simultaneously with the other person. To form the game board, each player places his or her Zone Cards in front of him or her, side by side and with the Raid area of each card toward his or her opponent.

3. Build An Air Force

Each Target Unit on the Zone Cards yields a certain number of Production Points. Add together the Production Point values of all your Target Units; this is the total number of Production Points you have available to build your air force.

Use your Production Points to purchase aircraft, surface units, Aces, and Event Cards. You may not exceed the number of Production Points yielded by your Target Units; if you can't make up the exact number from the units available to you, the excess points are lost.

Aces: Like Zone Cards, Aces are unique; you can't purchase more than one Ace of the same name.

4. Deploy Your Air Force

Starting with the First Player, each player sets his or her units on the game board:

Aircraft may be deployed in any of your Combat Air Patrol areas, or in the Base area of any of your zone cards. Aircraft may only be deployed in Base areas if the Unit Type Silhouette on the aircraft's Stat Card matches one of the silhouettes in that Base area.

Example: The B-25 may not be deployed at the Eastern Island Base; the silhouettes do not match.

Surface units (AA units and Radar units) may be placed in any of your AA unit areas. Attach each Ace to an eligible Fighter unit (place the Ace figure next to the selected Fighter figure). Keep your Event cards hidden from your opponent.

NOTE: The Second Player may not change his or her forces in response to the First Player's deployments.

5. Start Playing!

HOW TO WIN

War Eagles is played in Turns. At the end of turn ten, each player counts the Victory Points he or she has earned; the player with the higher Victory Point total is the winner.

Each player receives Victory Points for his or her Target Units that remain undestroyed at the end of the game, according to the Victory Point Value printed on the Zone Card. Each player also receives one Victory Point for each enemy unit (aircraft, AA unit, Radar unit, or Ace) destroyed during the game.

If both players' Victory Point totals are tied at the end of Turn 10, continue playing until one player has more Victory Points at the end of a complete turn.

PARTS OF THE GAME

Units
Most of the units in War Eagles are represented by wooden tiles, which have the information about the unit you'll need to play the game printed on the back and a picture of the unit on the front. The information presented on the tiles is:

Nationality: Each unit belongs to one of the major combatants of World War II.
- Germany (GE) (Axis)
- Japan (JP) (Axis)
- Soviet Union (SU) (Allied)
- United Kingdom (Britain) (UK) (Allied)
- United States (US) (Allied)

Name: Each unit has a name that refers only to that unit (or others identical to it). "Unique" units may have only one unit with the same name in a game.

Type: (aircraft only) Different aircraft types are affected differently by the rules and by Events.

Cost: The number of Production Points you must spend out of your Production Point Total to put this unit into play.

Range (aircraft only): The number of Zones the unit can enter during EACH of the phases in which it can move.

Damage Capacity: The number of hits required to destroy the unit.

Bombing Dice (aircraft only): The number of dice the unit rolls when attacking Surface Units in the Bombing Round.

Air Attack Dice (aircraft only): The number of dice the unit rolls when attacking Aircraft in an Air Attack Round.

Anti-Aircraft Dice (Surface Units only): The number of dice the unit rolls when attacking aircraft during the Anti-Aircraft Round.

Air Attack Die Modifier (Aces only): The amount by which each Air Attack Die rolled by the unit to which the Ace is attached is modified.

Special Ability: Many units have special rules that apply only to them. These rules may modify the movement or combat rules in this book, and "trump" the rules in this book when there's a conflict.

Silhouette: This gives information about where on the Zone Card a unit may be deployed, or the types of Bases at which an aircraft can land.

Year: The first year the unit is available for play. You'll use this if you play with the Advanced Rules.

Zone Cards
The Zone Cards represent areas of your homeland. Each produces resources, has areas to base your aircraft, and deducts from your Victory Points if you allow your opponent to destroy it.

Each Zone Card, besides acting as a part of the game board, also contains two Surface Units: the Target Unit and the Base Unit. (These units aren't represented by figures; each only exists as part of the Zone Card.)

The Target Unit represents the industry, military facilities, populations, and/or resources in the zone. Target Units have six values that are listed in the Target Unit area of the Zone Card:

- Name: The name of the Target Unit.
- Nationality: The Nationalities of Target Units are the same as for other units. The nationality of the Target Unit also applies to the Zone Card as a whole.
- AA Dice: This is the intrinsic Anti-Aircraft strength of the Target Unit; it is in addition to any AA units you may place in the zone. If the Target Unit is destroyed, you lose the use of these AA Dice.
- Damage Capacity: The number of hits required to destroy the Target Unit.
- Production Point Value: The number of Production Points this Target Unit makes available to you.
- Victory Point Value: The number of Victory Points you receive if this Target Unit is undestroyed at the end of turn 10.

The Base Unit represents the air force infrastructure in the zone. Base Units have five values, which are printed on the zone card:

- Name: The name of the Base Unit.
- Base Type: There are three types of Base Units: Airstrips, Airfields, and Airbases. Airbases represent full-capacity bases, capable of operating the heaviest aircraft. Airfields are less capable, but still have the capability to operate medium bombers. Airstrips have minimal facilities, usually tents and dirt or grass runways. These Bases can operate fighters, fighter-bombers, and very light bombers.
- AA Dice: This is the intrinsic Anti-Aircraft strength of the Base Unit; it is in addition to any AA units you may place in the Zone. If the Base Unit is destroyed, you lose the use of these AA Dice.
- Damage Capacity: The number of hits required to destroy the Base Unit. No aircraft may land at Base Units that have been destroyed.

Besides the Target and Base Areas, each Zone card also includes the following areas:
- Raid Area: Enemy aircraft attacking the units in the Zone are placed here.
- Combat Air Patrol Area: You place aircraft here to protect the units in the zone.
- Anti-Aircraft Area: Anti-Aircraft and Radar units are placed in this area.
- Repair Area: Aircraft needing repair are placed here.

Events
Event cards represent occurrences in the game that may change the rules during play. There are two kinds of events:
- Technology: Technology events represent advances made by one side or the other. Usually, Technology events have effects that last for the remainder of the game.
- Immediate: Immediate events represent short-term changes in conditions that change the playing environment, usually for one turn.

Event cards have three values:
- Name: The name of the event.
- Cost: The number of Production Points the unit costs to put into play.
- Description: The effects of the event.

Event effects overrule these rules.

BUILDING YOUR AIR FORCE

Selecting Targets
When selecting your Zone Cards, think about your overall strategy for the game. If you want to play a mostly defensive game, you'll want to pick Zone Cards whose Target Units provide the largest possible number of Victory Points. For a mostly offensive game, you'll want targets that provide a mix of self-defense, toughness, and Production Points. Sometimes, you may want to pick a target with high AA dice, a large damage capacity, and low VP just to ease your defensive load; such a target isn't very tempting to your enemy!

Don't forget that you need appropriate Bases for your aircraft. If you aren't using heavy bombers, you don't need an Airbase; but if you are, you need at least one!

Picking Units
The same considerations apply to selecting your units. Heavy bombers are ideal for an offensive strategy, but they require Airbase units and are relatively expensive. Aces can make your fighters more effective, but they cost PP and the loss of a fighter unit with an Ace yields your opponent 2 VP rather than one. Antiaircraft units are effective and cheap defensive pieces, but can be easy VP for your opponent, and are "stuck" in the zone in which you deploy them.

Picking Events
Using event cards can be expensive, but the right event in the right place can win the game. Remember, the more you spend on events, the less you have for units; the best use of events is to support a strategy you've already decided on.

Air Force Building Etiquette
You should build your air force secretly. Keep your event cards hidden from your opponent until you play them. Remember, the Second Player may not change the composition of his Air Force in response to the First Player's deployments!

HOW TO PLAY

War Eagles is played in a series of turns. The First Player always takes his or her turn first, followed by the Second Player. A "full turn" consists of both players taking their turns.

Each turn is made up of a series of phases. The phases in the order in which they make up each player's turn (the sequence of play) is as follows:

1. Event Phase
Each player may take turns playing any Event cards they want to, starting with the player whose turn it is. The effects of the card take effect immediately, and last as long as specified on the card. (If no duration is specified, the effects last until the end of the current player's turn.) The Event Phase ends when neither player has any more Event Cards they wish to play.

2. Launch Phase
During your Launch Phase, you may perform ONE of the following actions with EACH of your aircraft units:
- Raid: Move the unit from your Base Area to the Raid Area of any of your opponent's Zone Cards within the unit's range.
- Repair: Move the unit from your Base Area to the Repair Area of the same Zone Card. Remove any "hit" counters from the unit.
- Shuttle: Move the unit from your Base Area to the Base Area of any of your Zone Cards within range. The aircraft must be able to land at the selected Base (the silhouettes must match).

3. Action Phase
If you have aircraft in the Raid Area of any of your opponent's zone cards, do the following for EACH Zone card:

First Air Combat Round:
If your opponent has aircraft in the Combat Air Patrol Area of the Zone Card, the player with more Air Attack Dice has the initiative (each Ace adds his modifier to the total Air Attack Dice). The Initiative Player assigns his aircraft to attack opposing units, fighters and fighter-bombers first; if the other player has units left over after the Initiative Player has assigned all of his or her attacks, he or she may assign them to attack the Initiative Player's aircraft.

Starting with the Initiative Player, each player rolls the proper number of Air Attack Dice to resolve his or her assigned attacks. Place a "hit" counter next to each unit that is hit. Remove any aircraft that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its Damage Capacity from play.

Second Air Combat Round:
If your opponent still has aircraft in the Combat Air Patrol Area of the Zone Card, the player with more Air Attack Dice has the initiative (each Ace adds his modifier to the total Air Attack Dice). The Initiative Player assigns his aircraft to attack opposing units; if the other player has units left over after the Initiative Player has assigned all of his or her attacks, he or she may assign them to attack the Initiative Player's aircraft.

Starting with the Initiative Player, each player rolls the proper number of Air Attack Dice to resolve his or her assigned attacks. Place a "hit" counter next to each unit that is hit. Remove any aircraft that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its Damage Capacity from play.

Anti-Aircraft Round:
Each of your opponent's Surface Units in the same Zone with Anti-Aircraft Dice (including Target and Base units) may attack one of your aircraft units. Place a hit counter next to the targeted aircraft unit for each hit received. Remove any aircraft with a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its Damage Capacity from play.

Bombing Round:
Each of your aircraft with Bombing Dice may attack any enemy Surface Unit in the same Zone. Place a "hit" counter next to the unit or in the proper Area for each hit. Place a "destroyed" counter in the proper Area for each Base or Target unit that has a number of hit counters equal to or greater than its Damage Capacity (your opponent may choose to transfer hits that you made on a Base unit to any of the aircraft in that Base Area. All aircraft in a Base Area are destroyed when the Base is destroyed). Remove any unit from play that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its Damage Capacity.

Saving Round:
For EACH aircraft unit removed from play during the current Action Phase, the owner makes a Saving Roll. Units which fail their saving rolls are permanently removed from play and considered destroyed. Units which make successful saving rolls have all "hit" counters removed and are placed in the Repair area of the nearest zone containing a Base at which the unit can land. If two acceptable Bases are located at equal distances, the owner may choose the zone to which the unit is returned. Surface units never make saving rolls. If an Ace is attached to a unit that fails its saving roll, both the Ace and the aircraft are destroyed.

4. Landing Phase
Move each of your aircraft units that are in your opponent's Raid areas to any Base Area within the unit's range. Move all of your aircraft that are in your Combat Air Patrol Areas to any Base Area within the unit's range. Move all of your units that are in Repair areas to the Base area of the same Zone Card.

All of your aircraft units should now be in Base Areas. Any unit that cannot reach a Base Area at which it can land (for example, because its original Base Area has been destroyed) is destroyed with no saving roll.

5. Combat Air Patrol Phase
You may move any of your aircraft from their current Base areas to any of your Combat Air Patrol areas within the unit's range.

AIRCRAFT MOVEMENT

Each aircraft unit has a Range listed on its stat card. This is the number of zones that the unit may enter in Each of the Phases in which it can move (Launch Phase, Landing Phase, Combat Air Patrol Phase).

For movement, each Zone Card can be thought of as a "space" (or a square on a chessboard). Aircraft in a Zone can move to any Zone directly adjacent to it. Diagonal moves are not allowed.

For example, an aircraft with range 1 located in Zone A could move to any of the zones marked 1 in the same phase. An aircraft with range 2, starting in the same Zone, could move to any of the zones marked 1 or 2.

Aircraft are not required to move their full Range each movement; however, Range is NOT carried over from Phase to Phase. (An aircraft with a range of 2 that only moves 1 zone in the Launch Phase cannot then move 3 zones in the Landing Phase, for example.)

ABOUT COMBAT

Combat occurs during the Action Phase. First, opposing aircraft in the same Zone undergo up to two rounds of Air-To-Air Combat; then, the Surface Units in the Zone may fire at the raiding aircraft; and finally, the raiding aircraft have the opportunity to attack Surface Units in the Zone. After combat is concluded, aircraft that were removed from play have an opportunity to make saving rolls to determine if they were destroyed, or merely failed to make it to the target.

When playing through the Action Phase, keep the following general rules in mind:

1. Aircraft in the Base Area or Repair Area may not participate in combat (except that the player in whose Zone the combat is taking place may assign hits on his Base Unit to aircraft in that Base Area.) Only aircraft in the Raid and Combat Air Patrol Areas engage in combat.
2. Units attack as a unit. Air Attack, Bombing, and Anti-Aircraft Dice may not be split among several targets.
3. Once an aircraft unit has been selected as a target, it is "engaged." Engaged units may only fire at their attackers; they may not select other units as targets.

The general sequence of events in your Action Phase is as follows:

First Air Combat Round: Determine Initiative
Compare the total number of Air Attack Dice of your aircraft in the Raid Box to the total number of Air Attack Dice of your opponent's aircraft in the Combat Air Patrol box. Add the modifiers of any Aces attached to either player's fighters to the total. The player with the higher number of Air Attack Dice is the Initiative Player.

First Air Combat Round: Choose Targets
The Initiative Player selects targets for his or her fighters and fighter-bombers to shoot at. The following rules apply to target selection:

1. Only fighters and fighter/bombers may select targets in air-to-air combat (bombers and recon aircraft have their air attack dice printed in red in the Stat Card to help you remember this rule).
2. Only aircraft in the Raid and Combat Air Patrol areas of the Zone Card are eligible for air-to-air combat; aircraft in the Repair and Base areas are immune from target selection, and may not select targets themselves.
3. Each aircraft may select only one enemy aircraft to shoot at; an aircraft's air attack dice may not be split between more than one enemy.
4. An aircraft cannot select a target that's already being attacked unless no other targets are available. That is, you cannot "double-up" attacks until ALL the eligible enemy aircraft have been selected.
5. In the FIRST round of air combat, bombers and recon aircraft may not be selected until ALL enemy fighters and fighter-bombers have been engaged.

Once the Initiative Player has selected targets for all of his or her fighters and fighter-bombers, the non-initiative player may select targets for any of his or her fighters or fighter-bombers that have not been selected yet. Aircraft that HAVE been selected automatically engage the attacking unit. (If more than one unit is attacking, the engaged unit may select which of its attackers it will shoot at; it may not split its dice between more than one attacker.)

First Air Combat Round: Combat Resolution
The Initiative Player rolls the indicated number of dice for each of his engaged aircraft. Each six rolled causes a hit to be scored on the target aircraft; place a "hit" counter next to the figure.

Once the Initiative Player has rolled for all of his or her aircraft, the non-initiative rolls the indicated number of dice for each of his or her engaged aircraft. Each six rolled causes a hit to be scored on the target aircraft; place a "hit" counter next to the figure.

First Air Combat Round: Damage Assessment
Remove each aircraft that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its damage capacity from the game. Set these units to one side.

Second Air Combat Round: Determine Initiative
Compare the total number of Air Attack Dice of your surviving aircraft in the Raid Box to the total number of Air Attack Dice of your opponent's surviving aircraft in the Combat Air Patrol box. Add the modifiers of any Aces attached to either player's fighters to the total. The player with the higher number of Air Attack Dice is the Initiative Player.

Second Air Combat Round: Choose Targets
The Initiative Player selects targets for his or her fighters and fighter-bombers to shoot at. The following rules apply to target selection:

1. Only fighters and fighter/bombers may select targets in air-to-air combat (bombers and recon aircraft have their air attack dice printed in red in the Stat Card to help you remember this rule).
2. Only aircraft in the Raid and Combat Air Patrol areas of the Zone Card are eligible for air-to-air combat; aircraft in the Repair and Base areas are immune from target selection, and may not select targets themselves.
3. Each aircraft may select only one enemy aircraft to shoot at; an aircraft's air attack dice may not be split between more than one enemy.
4. An aircraft cannot select a target that's already being attacked unless no other targets are available. That is, you cannot "double-up" attacks until ALL the eligible enemy aircraft have been selected.

Once the initiative player has selected targets for all of his or her fighters and fighter-bombers, the non-initiative player may select targets for any of his or her fighters or fighter-bombers that have not been selected yet. Aircraft that HAVE been selected automatically engage the attacking unit. (If more than one unit is attacking, the engaged unit may select which of its attackers it will shoot at; it may not split its dice between more than one attacker.)

Second Air Combat Round: Combat Resolution
The Initiative Player rolls the indicated number of dice for each of his engaged aircraft. Each six rolled causes a hit to be scored on the target aircraft; place a "hit" counter next to the figure.

Once the Initiative Player has rolled for all of his or her aircraft, the non-initiative rolls the indicated number of dice for each of his or her engaged aircraft. Each six rolled causes a hit to be scored on the target aircraft; place a "hit" counter next to the figure.

Second Air Combat Round: Damage Assessment
Remove each aircraft that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its damage capacity from the game. Set these units to one side.

Anti-Aircraft Round
Your opponent selects targets for each of his or her anti-aircraft (AA) units, and for the AA Dice of his or her Base and Target units. AA Dice may not be split between units; however, the player may assign as many AA units as he or she wants to attack one aircraft.

Roll the indicated number of dice for each AA unit; each roll of six inflicts one hit on the targeted aircraft. Place a "hit" counter next to the aircraft figure. Once all the dice have been rolled, remove from play any aircraft that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its damage capacity. This may include aircraft that suffered some damage in air combat and were damaged again in the anti-aircraft round.

Bombing Round
Assign each of your aircraft with bombing dice to attack surface units. Aircraft may bomb any surface units, including AA units, Bases, and Targets. A single aircraft's bombing dice may not be split between different targets; however, more than one aircraft may attack the same target. Once all bombing aircraft have been assigned, roll the indicated number of dice for each unit; each "five" or "six" rolled inflicts one hit on the bombed unit. Place one "hit" counter next to the figure (or for Bases and Targets, in the Base or Target area; the Second Player may assign hits on Base units to the aircraft in that Base area, rather than the Base unit itself).

After all the attacking aircraft have rolled, remove each figure that has a number of "hit" counters equal to or greater than its damage capacity. Place a "destroyed" counter on each Base or Target unit that has a number of hit counters equal to or greater than its damage capacity.

Saving Round
Roll one die for each aircraft that was removed from play during the turn. On a roll of "five" or "six", return that unit to play by placing it in its owner's Base area. For any other roll, remove the unit from play permanently.

ABOUT EVENTS AND SPECIAL ABILITIES

Modifying Dice
Some Event Cards or Special Abilities modify either the number of dice a unit rolls or the results of the dice rolled. If an event or ability says that a unit "gets an additional" or "gets +1" attack die, the unit rolls one extra die above and beyond the dice listed on its stat card. This die is rolled at the same time as the unit's normal dice.

If the ability or event specifies that the unit "gets +1 to each" or "gets +1 to all" attack die or dice, add one to the number of pips showing on each die rolled.

Example:
The Axis player has attached the Adolph Galland Ace figure to a Ta-152 aircraft unit. The Ta-152 has the special ability "Interceptor", which grants it an extra air attack die when attacking heavy bombers in a zone containing a friendly Radar unit; the Galland's "Fighter Ace" ability gives it +1 to each air attack die.

If this unit attacks a B-17 (Allied heavy bomber unit) in a zone containing a radar unit, the Ta-152 would roll seven air attack dice, each of which would hit on a five or a six.

Modifying Rules
Some Events or special abilities modify the game rules. Whenever there's a conflict between the game rules and an Event or Special Ability, the Event or Special Ability takes precedence.

If an Event conflicts with a Special Ability, the Event takes precedence.

If two Event cards conflict, the last-played card takes precedence.

Events and Special Abilities Are Additive
Event Cards and Special Abilities of different names add together if they apply to the same unit. For example, if a unit has a special ability that gives it an extra air attack die, and an Event is played that gives it an extra air attack die, that unit would get two additional air attack dice.

There's one exception to this rule: Events and Special Abilities of the SAME name are not additive. For example, both the Werner Molders Ace unit and the Adolph Galland Ace unit have the "Fighter Ace" special ability. If both these Ace units were attached to one fighter unit, that fighter unit would get only +1 to its die rolls, not +2.

ADVANCED RULES

Once you're comfortable with the Standard Rules, you may want to try some more advanced rules to enhance the game.

Nationality Limitations
Aircraft and Surface Units may only be deployed in zones where the Target Unit is of the same nationality. German aircraft may only land in zones containing a German Target Unit; Japanese aircraft may only land in zones containing Japanese Target Units. US and UK units may not enter zones containing Soviet Target Units.

Time Limitations
Each unit's stat Card lists a year that the unit first becomes available. To limit your game to a certain year, allow each player to purchase only units available in that year or earlier.

Theater Limitations
Historically, the Pacific Theater and European Theater of Operations had very few overlaps. If you'd like to simulate operations in one of these theaters; or the Eastern Front, you can use the following rules:

Pacific Theater:
- The Axis player may select only Zone Cards containing Japanese Target Units.
- The Axis player may purchase only Japanese units or Event Cards.
- The Allied Player must select Zone Cards containing only Target Units from this list: Midway Islands, Port Moresby, Singapore, Port Arthur, Tank Farm, Cavite Bay, Schofield Barracks.
- The Allied Player may only select Port Arthur or any Soviet units or Event Cards if the game takes place in 1945.
- Allied units may only deploy in or land in zones containing a Target Unit of the same nationality.

Western Europe:
- The Axis player may select only Zone Cards containing a German Target Unit.
- The Axis Player may purchase only German units or Event Cards.
- The Allied player is limited to zones containing the following Target Units: Landing Beach, London, Portsmouth, Coventry, Birmingham, Malta.
- The Allied Player may purchase only US or UK units or Event Cards.

Eastern Front:
- The Axis player may select only zones containing German Target Units.
- The Axis Player may purchase only German units or Event Cards.
- The Allied player may select only Zone Cards containing Soviet Target Units.
- The Allied Player may select only Soviet units or Event Cards.

CAMPAIGNS

For an even more detailed playing experience, you can recreate specific air campaigns of World War 2. NOTE: These scenarios require full sets of Zone Cards and miniatures.

Blitzkrieg!
The air war in Western Europe, from late 1939 through the Battle of Britain.
- The Allied player may purchase only UK units or Events; the Axis player may purchase only German units or Events. Both sides are limited to units available in 1940 or earlier.

The Japanese Advance:
The lightning advance of the Japanese through Malaysia and Indonesia, December 1941- May 1942.
- Both sides are limited to units available in 1941 or earlier.
- The Allied player may purchase only 80 Production Points' worth of US units or Event Cards, and only 34 Production Points' worth of UK units or Event Cards. The Allied player may not purchase Radar units or Aces.
- Allied units may not start the game deployed in Combat Air Patrol areas; Allied units may only deploy or land in zones containing a Target Unit of the same nationality. US and UK units may not be placed in the Raid area of the same zone in the same turn.
- The Axis player may purchase only Japanese units and Event Cards. The Axis player receives the following Event Cards free before purchasing his or her units: 2 Bounce cards (JP), 1 Bonus Production (JP), 1 Fuel Shortage (JP).
- Surprise Attack: Before the beginning of turn 1, the Axis player may take 1 free turn. During this free turn, all Japanese bombers receive 2 additional Bombing Dice, and the Axis Player gets +1 to all Japanese Bombing Dice rolls.

Russian Front:
The war on the steppes of the USSR seemed endless.
- The Allied player may purchase only SU units or Events; the Axis player may purchase only German units or Events. Both sides are limited to units available in 1943 or earlier.
- The Allied player receives the following Event Cards free before purchasing his or her units: 1 Russian Winter.
- Purges: Allied units may not start the game deployed into Combat Air Patrol areas.
- Partisans: During each Allied Event Phase, the Allied player may choose 1 Axis unit and roll 1 die. If the roll is a 6, place a hit counter next to that unit.
