[b]Further Reading for War Eagles[/b]

War Eagles is, first and last, a game. It's entertainment, not education.  But the story of the strategy of air power, and how it developed before and during World War II, is a fascinating one.  Its lessons persist to the present day, and have influenced many of the events of this century and the last decade of the last.  No game about that period would be worth playing if it wasn't rooted in the discoveries, triumphs, and brutal tragedies of that learning process.  If you're interested in learning more, these books can provide an outline of what happened, why it happened, and what the principals thought they were doing. Maybe most importantly, the stories of the pilots and commanders who fought that war can help you imagine what it was like to be in the center of that bloody and terrifying time.
