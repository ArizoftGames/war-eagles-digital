### SAVE:

### NEW:    
[NYI] Allows you to set up and start playing a new game of War Eagles.  This option will provide you with the choice to start the tutorial or start a new full game. Clicking the "Restart" button at the bottom-center of the screen will restart the program, beginning with the opening animation.

[NYI] Starts the tutorial scenario.  Pressing the Escape key or the spacebar, or clicking the "Restart" button in the lower-righthand corner of the screen, will restart the program beginning with the opening animation.  

### CREDITS:  
The most important screen in War Eagles;  without these folks' contributions, and their generous licensing, this game simply wouldn't exist.  Note that contributors are listed by name under each category to which they've contributed.  In the case of composite models, each of the modelmakers who contributed is credited with the model.  For the musical themes, each of the songs used to create the theme track is credited with the artist's name.  

You can access the Credit Screen from the Main Menu by clicking "Credits."  Pressing the Escape Key, the spacebar, or clicking the "Back" button in the lower-right corner will close the Credit Screen and return you to the Main Menu.  

### OPTIONS:  
[NYI] Opens the Options screen, which allows you to change your video resolution, adjust the volumes of the game music and sopund effects, and provides some choices about how you control the game and how gameplay proceeds.  Clicking the "Accept" button at the bottom will activate the options you've selected and cause the game to save. Clicking the "Cancel" button, or pressing the Escape key or spacebar, will return you to the Main Menu (as if you had paused the game).

**Video and Display:**  Allows you to set the resolution the game plays at (Standard, HD, 2K, 4K, or 8K).  The game automatically detects your video hardware;  but if you want to use a separate monitor, or cast the view, this lets you choose manually.  You can also choose to customize the way the user interface looks;  by default, it will present in colors that represent your nation, but you can use the War Eagles color palette, a high-contrast palette, or a system-style view.  If you like the national colors but find the font hard to read, you can adjust that here as well. The game also represents the phase and turn you’re in by a fictitious time and date;  you can set the dispaly to simple phase/turn here. 

**Audio:**  You can adjust the volume of the music, the sound effects, and the voiceovers;  or you can adjust them simultaneously using the master volume.

**Controls:** Presents the actions available in the game and the keys, mouse clicks, or controller inputs to perform them.  You can also enable your controller here.
